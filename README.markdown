- put xdebug.ini at /etc/php5/conf.d 
- <i>service apache2 restart</i>

Advisor: the code was writed quickly. The next time, better ;-)

No trace the tracer!
If the ini_set don't run, add this to your Apache VirtualHost file:
<pre>
  &lt;Directory /srv/www/lab/xdebug-trace-gui&gt;
                Order allow,deny
                allow from 10.10.10
                deny from all
                php_value 'xdebug.auto_trace' 'Off'
        &lt;/Directory&gt;
</pre>

look at the file xdebug.httpd.conf for an Apache VirtualHost sample configuration.
 
Change the directory and the IP range to your convenience.
